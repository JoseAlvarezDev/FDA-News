**FDA Last News** is a premium, **fully responsive** data aggregation platform designed to solve the "Information Overload" problem in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. We transform raw regulatory data from the FDA into actionable market intelligence, optimized for both **Human Search (SEO)** and **AI Context (AI SEO)**.

## 🚀 Why This Matters for Investors

Investing in Bio-Pharma is high-risk and high-reward. **Timing is everything.** A single FDA approval or recall can shift billions in market cap in minutes. 

Our tool simplifies the investor's life by:

*   **Cutting Through the Noise**: We filter out irrelevant filler and focus on **PDUFA dates**, **FDA approvals**, and **negative enforcement actions (recalls)**.
*   **Connecting the Dots**: We don't just show you a drug name; we show you the **Market Reaction** instantly through integrated real-time stock charts.
*   **Regulatory Alpha**: By combining official OpenFDA data with financial news from Finnhub, you get the "Why" behind the "What" before the mainstream media catches up.
*   **No More Manual Hunting**: Stop refreshing 20 different government RSS feeds. We centralize the official FDA enforcement reports and press releases in one glassmorphic dashboard.
